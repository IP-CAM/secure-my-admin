# SecureMyAdmin Lite - VQMOD #

Lots of people out there suggests you to rename the opencart's admin folder to prevent people from having access to their administration backend or purchase plugins that changes your admin folder's name.

But by doing this, it breaks lots of pre-installed plugins and causing lots of problems such as upgrading or install new plugins .

As renaming opencart's admin folder is not officially recommended by opencart.

The aim of SecureMyAdmin is to prevent Unauthorized people from accessing the administration backend without renaming the admin folder allowing easy upgrades and worry free installation of other plugins.

SecureMyAdmin implements a secure key and value into the administrator backend URL ,only owners with the key and value are able to access the administration backend.
